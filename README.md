# homebridge-harbor-breeze-hub

This is a [homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge) plugin that allows you to control your Harbor Breeze ceiling fan using Apple HomeKit.

To get started, you will first need to create a Harbor Breeze Hub. You will need a 315MHz transmitter and a Raspberry Pi. If you are already using a Raspberry Pi for Homebridge, you may use the same one to act as a hub. To download the hub software and view detailed instructions, visit the [Harbor Breeze Hub repository](https://github.com/enlilodisho/harbor-breeze-hub).

#### More information coming soon.

This plugin is not yet functional. More information will be provided once it is somewhat usable.
